# 🌱 Smart Plant Watering System

An IoT-based Smart Plant Watering System using Arduino.  
The system uses a **soil moisture sensor** to monitor the soil condition and automatically turns a **water pump ON/OFF** to keep the plant healthy.  

## 🚀 Features
- Soil moisture monitoring  
- Automatic water pump control  
- Beginner-friendly and low-cost  
- Simulation available in Tinkercad

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- Soil Moisture Sensor  
- Relay Module  
- Water Pump (simulated in Tinkercad)  
- Jumper Wires  

## 💻 How to Use
1. Copy the code from `plant_watering.ino` file.  
2. Open in Arduino IDE and upload to your Arduino.  
3. Connect the circuit as shown in simulation.  
4. Adjust moisture threshold in the code if needed.
